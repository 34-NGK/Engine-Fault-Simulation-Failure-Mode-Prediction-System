# Engine Fault Simulation & Failure Mode Prediction System
# Author: Oluwatomi Oladunni
#
# This project predicts engine fault conditions using real sensor data
# like temperature, vibration, torque, RPM, and power output.
# The goal is to help companies identify early warning signs of system failure
# and improve maintenance decisions before breakdowns happen.
#
# The model applies data cleaning, outlier removal, and machine learning
# (Random Forest / XGBoost) to detect fault patterns and classify engine states.
#
# Key outputs include:
#   - Accuracy, recall, and precision scores for reliability validation.
#   - Feature importance charts showing the most critical engine variables.
#   - A design review summary documenting verification and validation results.
#
# Why it's useful:
#   This system gives engineers and companies the ability to
#   analyze fault data, understand what causes failures,
#   and make data-driven improvements to performance and safety.
#
# Tools used:
#   Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, XGBoost, SMOTE

#
# In short:
#   A data-driven reliability project that shows how machine learning can support smarter maintenance, reduce costs, and increase engine uptime.
